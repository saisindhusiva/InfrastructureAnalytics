Workflow:

Data Ingestion & Integration:

Collect data from various sources, including World Bank Projects, SAM.gov tenders, and multi-modal data.
Integrate data into a unified database for analysis.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) such as BERT or RoBERTa for NLP tasks.
Apply NLP to extract entities (e.g., governments, companies) and relationships (e.g., collaborations, projects) from textual descriptions.

Ensemble Models:

Enhance the accuracy and reliability of entity extraction and relationship mapping by using ensemble models.
Combine predictions from multiple models to improve results.

Multi-modal Data Processing:

Analyze multi-modal data, including images and videos, to identify entities mentioned.
Combine the results from multi-modal data analysis with textual data interpretations.

Knowledge Graph Creation:

Populate a knowledge graph (e.g., Neo4j) with extracted entities and relationships.
Define various types of relationships between entities to capture collaborations, contractual agreements, funding, ownership, and more.
Ensure that the knowledge graph is dynamic and can evolve as new data becomes available.

Data Visualization & Analytics:

Develop a user-friendly graphical interface for stakeholders to query the knowledge graph.
Allow users to explore entity nodes and discover insights into the extent and nature of collaborations.
Provide recommendations for potential future collaborations based on GPT API and knowledge graph analytics.
This workflow allows for efficient data processing, relationship extraction, and visualization of insights, helping stakeholders understand infrastructure project networks and make informed decisions. The architecture can be adapted and extended based on specific project requirements and data sources.
